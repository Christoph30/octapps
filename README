Welcome to octapps, the unofficial LSC octave-script repository.

This is available via git with the following command:

git clone git://git.aei.uni-hannover.de/shared/octapps.git

To use these any octapps functions within octave, you can either

*) add the following to your .bashrc

export OCTAPPS_TOP=<path-to-your-octapps-dir>
eval `${OCTAPPS_TOP}/octapps_setup.m bash`

(adjust correspondingly for different shells).

or execute the following from within octave:
octave> source ("<path-to-your-octapps-dir>/octapps_setup.m")

If you also use matapps, it's probably important to add the octapps
activation above AFTER any matapps activation in your .bashrc or
.cshrc

Some scripts require .oct files to be built, which you can do
by running

octave> octapps_build_oct

You may need to refresh your path setup (see above) after doing this.
The .oct modules require you to install SWIG (http://www.swig.org/),
version 2.0.4 or greater is recommended.
