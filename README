Welcome to OctApps, the unofficial LSC Octave script repository.

Bugs should be reported to:
https://bugs.ligo.org/redmine/projects/octapps

OctApps is available via git with the following command:
$ git clone git://git.aei.uni-hannover.de/shared/octapps.git

To use any OctApps functions with Octave, first run

$ make

to generate the user environment setup scripts, then either add

source /path/to/octapps/octapps-user-env.sh

to your .bashrc, or

source /path/to/octapps/octapps-user-env.csh

to your .cshrc. You will also need to run "make" after adding
any new directories to OctApps.

If you have SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) installed, running

$ make

will also build .oct modules which are required by some scripts.

To execute the OctApps test suite, consisting of tests embedded
in Octave script files, run

$ make check
