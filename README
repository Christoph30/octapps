Welcome to octapps, the unofficial LSC octave-script repository.

This is available via git with the following command:

git clone git://git.aei.uni-hannover.de/shared/octapps.git

To use these any octapps functions within octave, you can either

*) add the following to your .bashrc

export OCTAPPS_TOP=<path-to-your-octapps-dir>
eval `${OCTAPPS_TOP}/octapps_setup.m bash`

(adjust correspondingly for different shells).

or execute the following from within octave:
octave> source ("<path-to-your-octapps-dir>/octapps_setup.m")

If you also use matapps, it's probably important to add the octapps
activation above AFTER any matapps activation in your .bashrc or
.cshrc
