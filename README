Welcome to OctApps, the unofficial LSC Octave script repository.
Homepage: https://gitmaster.atlas.aei.uni-hannover.de/octapps

Bugs should be reported to:
https://bugs.ligo.org/redmine/projects/octapps

OctApps is available via git with the following command:
$ git clone git://gitmaster.atlas.aei.uni-hannover.de/octapps/octapps.git

To use any OctApps functions with Octave, first run

$ make

to generate the user environment setup scripts, then either add

source /path/to/octapps/octapps-user-env.sh

to your .bashrc, or

source /path/to/octapps/octapps-user-env.csh

to your .cshrc. You will also need to run "make" after adding
any new directories to OctApps.

If you have SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) installed, running

$ make

will also build .oct modules which are required by some scripts.
You will need to install the development features of Octave, i.e.
whichever package provides the script 'mkoctfile', in order to
compile .oct modules.

To execute the OctApps test suite, consisting of tests embedded
in Octave script files, run

$ make check
